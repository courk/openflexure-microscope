# OpenFlexure Microscope
A 3D Printable microscope and translation stage. 

This repository holds my OpenSCAD designs for a 3 axis flexure stage and microscope.  It's a 
remarkably nice little mechanism with high accuracy and low drift.  You can read all about it
http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4941068

With apologies for not having put it into Git until version 5.11, this should now be the 
canonical place for said little microscope, and I'll now be able to make branches for fun
versions that do different things.  There's a step by step assembly guide with lots and 
lots of photos in the zip file release, along with the STL files.  Releases live here:
http://docubricks.com/projects/openflexure-microscope

I'll try to update that link whenever I make a new release.

## Kits and License
This project is open-source and is released under the CERN open hardware license.  We will
also soon make kits and fully-assembled microscopes available to buy at:
http://www.waterscope.org/

## Printing it yourself
To build the microscope, go to http://docubricks.com/projects/openflexure-microscope and
download the STL files and instructions.  Don't just print everything from the STL folder,
as currently it contains some parts that must be printed multiple times, and other parts
that are redundant.  I plan to implement an automated build system in the future, that will
generate a nice STL folder (or even pre-plated prints), but for now please refer to 
DocuBricks for printing instructions.

If you want to print the current development version, you can compile the STL from the 
OpenSCAD files or download the STL files from here - but please still consult the DocuBricks
documentation for quantities and tips on print settings, etc.
