* The microscope stage actuators need a tension band to provide a *
* reciprocal force between the captive nut in the gear and the    *
* stage arm. The recommendation is to use a Viton O-ring, but if  *
* you have a 3d printer can reliably print with TPU filament, you *
* can print this instead and use it in place of the O-ring.       *
*                                                                 *
* Print this part using .1mm layer height, with randomized        *
* perimeter start and end positions if possible. For strength,    *
* The part should be printed entirely with perimeters, no gap     *
* fill. The part is designed to be printed with a 0.4mm nozzle.   *
* Printing with a 1mm nozzle hasn't been tested, and isn't        *
* recommended. 
*                                                                 *
