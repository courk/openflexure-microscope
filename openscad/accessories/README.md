# Microscope accessories

This folder contains OpenSCAD files that build various 
accessories for the microscope that aren't considered part
of the main build.  Currently this includes an adapter for
a 1" disc (allowing you to mount e.g. an optical fibre 
holder or resolution target on the sample stage) and some
options for mounting the microscope onto a plate.

These files aren't generally included in the build script, 
and tend not to be extensively tested - so treat them
with caution and do check they actually work before relying
on them.

Some of the more useful accessories have their own 
repository, for example a [travel case] Richard uses.
