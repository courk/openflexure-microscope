* This is part of the OpenFlexure microscope, an open-source      *
* microscope and 3-axis translation stage.  It gets really good   *
* precision over a ~10mm range, by using plastic flexure          *
* mechanisms.                                                     *
* This file generates a small gear, for motor control.            *
