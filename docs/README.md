OpenFlexure Microscope
======================

This folder contains the documentation and STL files for the OpenFlexure microscope.  The source (for the moment) lives on GitHub.

Please don't just launch into printing the STL files in the STL folder.  You need different quantities of each one and there are some alternatives where you only need one out of a few different files.  This is described in the documentation, but if you're in a hurry you can also check the README.md file in the STL folder.

To read the assembly instructions, you need to transform the XML file according to the included stylesheet.  If you open the `openflexure microscope.docubricks.xml` file in Firefox this should happen as if by magic.  If you can't do that or it doesn't work, hopefully it will be viewable online in the near future at www.docubricks.com.  Failing that, contact me for a PDF!

There is also an HTML version of the documentation, OpenFlexure Microscope-hiddenonly.html.  This should work in most modern web browsers.

This project is released under the CERN open hardware license, and was developed by Richard Bowman in 2014-16.
