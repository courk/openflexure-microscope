OpenFlexure Microscope
======================

This folder contains the documentation and STL files for the OpenFlexure microscope.  The source (for the moment) lives on GitHub.

Please don't just launch into printing the STL files in the STL folder.  You need different quantities of each one and there are some alternatives where you only need one out of a few different files.  This is described in the documentation, but if you're in a hurry you can also check the README.md file in the [builds folder](https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_microscope/tree/master/builds).

To read the assembly instructions, you need to use the DocuBricks viewer.  The easiest way to do this is online - it's possible to view the view the [current development documentation](http://rwb27.github.io/openflexure_microscope/docubricks/current_master_version.html) online.  You can also view [instructions from a specific commit or branch](http://rwb27.github.io/openflexure_microscope/docubricks/docubricks-viewer-pasteurl.html).

There may also be static HTML or PDF versions.  These come with a health warning that they may not be 100% up to date as it currently relies on a manual build process - but if you are reading this in a release ZIP file, it should be.  The easiest way to get an up to date version is probably to view it online and save the page (or print to PDF).  The stylesheet for printing should produce something that, while not perfect, is usable.

This project is released under the CERN open hardware license, and was developed by Richard Bowman in 2014-17.
