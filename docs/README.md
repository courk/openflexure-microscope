OpenFlexure Microscope
======================

This folder contains the documentation and STL files for the OpenFlexure microscope.  The source (for the moment) lives on GitHub.

Please don't just launch into printing the STL files in the STL folder.  You need different quantities of each one and there are some alternatives where you only need one out of a few different files.  This is described in the documentation, but if you're in a hurry you can also check the README.md file in the STL folder.

To read the assembly instructions, you need to use the DocuBricks viewer.  The easiest way to do this is online - as of September 2017 it's possible to view the [current development version](http://rwb27.github.io/openflexure_microscope/docubricks/viewertest-xml.html).  

There is also an HTML version of the documentation, OpenFlexure Microscope-hiddenonly.html.  This should work in most modern web browsers and is currently the best option if you want something that will work offline or you need to view this specific version.  It comes with a health warning that it may not be 100% up to date as it currently relies on a manual build process - but if you are reading this in a release ZIP file, it should be.

This project is released under the CERN open hardware license, and was developed by Richard Bowman in 2014-16.
