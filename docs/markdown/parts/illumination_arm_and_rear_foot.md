# Manufacturing Instructions
## Step

The illumination arm fits on to the microscope using a dovetail, and includes the rear foot.  The condenser lens version will also work without a lens, though the image won't be as bright.

 
The illumination arm is available in several versions: `illumination_and_rear_foot_[version].stl`.  You can choose either adjustable arm with a single LED or one that uses a condenser lens (`_condenser`).  It's important to match the type of microscope you're using (`LS65`, `LS75`, or `SS40`).  If you are using a riser to make space for a larger objective (if you've got a 35mm parfocal length objective) you'll need the `LS75` version.  If you are using tall feet, you will need the `_tall` version.
