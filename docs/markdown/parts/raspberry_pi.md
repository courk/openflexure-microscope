# Manufacturing Instructions
## Step
Any model will do!  If you buy a kit, it may or may not come with a Pi.  NB if you buy a Pi Zero, only the Zero+ has a camera connector, and even that needs a special lead.  Of course, if you're using a camera that's not the Raspberry Pi camera module, you can use whatever USB-compatible device you like.
