# The OpenFlexure Microscope: Assembly Instructions
The OpenFlexure Microscope is a 3D printable microscope, with a very precise mechanical translation stage.  It can be fitted with basic webcam-based optics, or more expensive optics based on a traditional microscope objective for higher image quality.  It can also be motorised.  These instructions will take you through how to assemble the microscope optical and mechanical parts.

## Printing the parts
Before we start, a note on printing - there are many possible versions of the microscope, so don't just print everything in the folder of STL files.  Currently, there's a readme document in the ``builds`` folder explaining how to select your versions.  Please do consult it before printing.  Also note that the parts are designed to print without support material on most RepRap type printers.  If you use support material, the parts will be difficult to clean up, and may well be damaged in the process - particularly the delicate main body.

## Contents
Assembly is broken up into several steps:
* [Assembling the actuators](./1_actuator_assembly.md) deals with the mechanism for moving the stage.
* The optics module comes next, either the [basic optics module](./2a_basic_optics_module.md) or the [high resolution optics module](./2b_high_resolution_optics_module.md).
* [Illumination](./3_illumination.md) covers attaching the condenser.
* [Sample clips and wiring](./4_clips_and_wiring) completes the microscope.
* [Motors](./5_motors.md) can be added for automatic control.

Happy building!
