# Manufacturing Instructions
## Step
These tools make it much easier to remove the lens from a Raspberry Pi camera module.  See the documentation for the Raspberry Pi Camera Mount/Extension Tube for instructions.  These tools are for version 2 of the camera board.  The board gripper for v1 is included for convenience - you'll need a small pair of pliers (I like mini combination pliers) to unscrew the lens if you have v1 of the board.  v2 of the Raspberry Pi camera module now comes with a lens removal tool, which is better than the printed one - but the board gripper is still useful.
