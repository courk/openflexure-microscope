## Step
If you are not simply using the lens that came with your camera, you will need an RMS microscope objective.  The LS65 version of the microscope body is compatible with 25mm parfocal length objectives; if you have a longer 35mm parfocal length objective you'll need to either print a taller LS75 body, or fit a 10mm spacer to raise the sample up higher.  If you are using an RMS objective, you'll also need to use a tube lens; 16mm diameter, 40mm focal length (e.g. [Comar 40 PQ 16](http://www.comaroptics.com/components/lenses/simple-convex-lenses/quality-planoconvex-lenses#row-40_pq_16))
