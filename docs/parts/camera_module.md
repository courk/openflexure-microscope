# Manufacturing Instructions
## Step
NB I've pictured v1.3 of the camera board here; the microscope is designed to work with v2 of the board, although older versions of the optics module exist that work with v1.  You can also use a webcam, and there are versions of the optics module available to use the Logitech C270 and a USB webcam supplied by WaterScope.
