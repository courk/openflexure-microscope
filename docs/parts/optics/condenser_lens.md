# Condenser Lens

## Details
*   **Focal length:** 5mm
*   **Outer diameter:** 12.7mm
*   **Material:** PMMA

The illumination needs a condenser lens, and so far I have generally sourced these in bulk from China.  They are designed for collimating LEDs, and don't produce a beautiful image, but they are adequate for our purposes.  Searching AliExpress for 5mm and 13mm usually brings up the right thing.
