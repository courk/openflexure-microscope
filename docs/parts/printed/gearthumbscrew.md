# Manufacturing Instructions
## Step
These gears are used to control the leadscrews that move the stage.  You can replace them with more comfortable thumbscrews if desired, or use stepper motors to drive them automatically.  You need three gears.  NB the gears are designed to print with the circular face down, this avoids marring of the teeth and helps it stick to the bed better.
